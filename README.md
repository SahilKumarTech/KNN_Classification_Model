# KNN Classification Model

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification** using scikit-learn.  
It generates a synthetic dataset, trains a KNN Classifier, and evaluates the model using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## Features
- Synthetic dataset generation with `make_classification`
- Train-test split
- KNN Classifier training & prediction
- Model evaluation with:
  - Accuracy Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report

## Installation
Make sure you have Python 3.x and the required libraries installed.
